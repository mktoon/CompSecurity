to compile and run project2_encryption 
Compile the code with the following command:
g++ encryption.cpp -lcrypto -lssl -o encryption

This will create an executable file named encryption.
then run the executable with the following command: 
./encryption encryptedMessage.txt pubkey.pem privkey.pem

The program will first decrypt the encrypted message with the public key and save the
 decrypted message to a file named symmetric.txt. Then it will encrypt a sample text file named original.txt 
 with the decrypted message as the symmetric key and save the encrypted file to a file named encrypted.txt. 
 Finally, it will decrypt the encrypted file with the private key and print the decrypted text to the console.

for project2_decryption.cpp: Compile the code with the OpenSSL library. You can use the following command to compile the code:

g++ -o project2_decryption project2_decryption.cpp -lcrypto
This command will generate an executable file named project2_decryption.

Run the executable by typing the command 
./project2_decryption signed.txt public.pem symmetric.txt

This command will verify the signature of the signed file using the public key, 
decrypt the signed file using the symmetric key, and write the decrypted output to a file named decrypted.txt in the same directory.

After the program finishes running, you can open the decrypted.txt file to view the decrypted output.
