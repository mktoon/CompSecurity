I created makefiles for questions 2a,2b,2c,2d.
to compile and run open folder ie 2a then make, then run as question2a respectively. same for all the questions in number 2. 
tot test 2a with key of choice, you simply need to modify the key array in the main function.

for 2b:
to compile and run: 
make, ./question2b


for 2c:
to compile and run:
make,  ./question2c
to use a different key: you would need to modify the key array in the main() function to contain the bits of the key you want to use.

for 2d:
to compile and run:
make, ./question2d
To use a different key in the above code, you need to replace the current key value with the new key value. In the code provided, the key is defined as a constant uint64_t variable called "key". You can replace the value of this variable with the value of your own key.

For example, to use the key "0x133457799BBCDFF1", you can change the line:

const uint64_t key = 0x0123456789ABCDEF;

to:

const uint64_t key = 0x133457799BBCDFF1;
Once you have changed the key value, you can run the program with the new key value to encrypt or decrypt messages.
